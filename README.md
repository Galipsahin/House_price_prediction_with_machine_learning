This thesis aims to determine and predict housing prices in Istanbul. Considering the diversity of factors affecting house prices and the importance of these factors for homeowners and investors, the goal is to mitigate the adverse effects of price
fluctuations, especially in large cities. This study aims to identify the factors influencing housing prices in Istanbul and use various machine learning techniques to predict
these prices. The problem is defined by stating that houses are one of the fundamental needs in human life, and the increasing demand due to population growth causes
prices to change continuously. Since this change is faster and more pronounced in
large cities like Istanbul, it is crucial for homeowners and investors to have predictable prices. It is emphasized that this study is designed to meet this need. The industrial and academic importance of the problem is highlighted. Identifying the factors affecting house prices provides important information about a country's economic situation and contributes to the development of economic policies. Additionally, predicting house prices is important for investors as it reduces risks and allows for effective portfolio management. The accuracy of urban planning decisions can also be improved through these analyses.
